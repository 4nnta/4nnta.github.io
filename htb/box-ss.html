			<p>Writeup on $w4g$h0p, damn there's not gonna be any format on this page, so it's gonna look ugly as hell :(</p>
			<p>First thing to do is to gather some information. A quick <b>ifconfig</b> shows that our IP address is 10.10.16.24. This will be useful later.</p>
			<img src="/htb/pics/ss/ss1.png">
			<p>A <b>nmap</b> shows that there are 2 services running on this ip address, we will skip the attemp on <b>ssh</b> and focus on apache being host on port 80. <b>Searchsploit</b> did not return any hit on that apache version.</p>
			<img src="/htb/pics/ss/ss2.png">
			<p>Accessing this IP address on a browser, I see that Magento is being used. Looking for the version of Magento being used might be useful. I attempted some Magento detecting service online, but none of them work, so I used <b>gobuster</b> to enumerate the directory list. I also noticed that this IP address timed out with error code 503 a lot. <b>gobuster</b> did return some promising directory to look at</p>
			<img src="/htb/pics/ss/ss3.png">
			<p>Found the Magento version in /var folder, which is 1.9.0. A quick <b>Searchsploit</b> on Magento 1.9 returned a hit. It seems to be an exploit to generate an admin user on Magento admin panel</p>
			<img src="/htb/pics/ss/ss4.png">
			<img src="/htb/pics/ss/ss5.png">
			<p>Downloaded the exploit, modify it a bit on the url section, and run, I managed to generate an admin user on Magento admin panel. I also get access to package management on Magento using this credential.</p>
			<img src="/htb/pics/ss/ss6.png">
			<p>I found a backdoor package by Lavalamp on github, and modify the IndexController.php with a php reverse shell spawn written by pentestmonkey. I managed to upload this backdoor package to the server.</p>
			<p>Setting up a listening port using <b>netcat</b>, I triggered the backdoor through the url. Successfully spawned a shell on 10.10.10.140 under www-data privilege</p>
			<p>A quick <b>cat</b> check on /home/haris/user.txt shows that I have access to this user. Got the user flag!</p>
			<p><b>sudo -l</b> shows that www-data user have permission to run /usr/bin/vi under sudo without password for any files in /var/www/html/. I created a bash script in /var/www/html/ that cat /root/root.txt and run /usr/bin/vi using sudo permission. Got the root flag!</p>
