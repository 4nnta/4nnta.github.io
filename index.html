			<h1>Hi there!</h1>
			<p>My name is Phong, or Justin, whichever you prefer. I'm currently a junior at University of Denver, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have experience in competitive programming in high school, where I achieved some minor prizes in the national competition, and I was an average competitor on codeforces and codechef. I'm confident in Java and C++, and a little less confident in Python. My laptop runs only in Ubuntu Linux, so I have some amount of Linux experience too. </p>
			<p>My biggest hobby is puzzle solving, which leads to my interest in algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and recently information security. I knew about CTF, HackTheBox (HTB), and then OSCP from one of my friend. At that time, I had plenty of free time, so I actuallly give the invitation code challenge of HTB a try. I was struggling a bit, having no prior knowledge of cryptology, nor anything CTF-related, but I managed to make it in. However, I was extremely unmotivated to do anything back then, so I didn't touch it until 2 months later, where I managed to root my first box SwagShop with a lot of help from my aforementioned friend. This blog, inspired by him, will serve as a "diary" and a motivation for myself on my infosec progress. I will also upload things that I'm interested about in computer science and mathematics too. I hope you guys do well, and, enjoy the content (even though it might not be enjoyable).</p>
			<p><b>P/S:</b> a minor thing, I have no experience in making websites at all, so I'll learn using web development scripting tools on the way, first stop is probably gonna be efficient in html.</p>
