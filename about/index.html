			<h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome to w4nntaland folks!</h1>
			<p>My name is Phong. I'm a third year at University of Denver, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
			<p>I'm interested in algorithms, data structures, combinatorial mathematics, and recently info security. For some background, I'm efficient in Java and C++, and currently working on my Python and scripting languages (Bash, Perl). I also have experience with Linux, since it is the main environment on my personal laptop.</p>
			<p>Apart from computer software stuff, I'm also interested in PC hardwares and cooking. They are pretty much the way for me to relax and enjoy my time (normal people watch pornhub, I watch PC porn okay? :D).</p>
			<p>In summer 2019, I had a long period of time where my work was really boring, and I was extremely unmotivated to do anything beside sleeping and watching youtube :(. I felt really unproductive, and although it kinda felt good being lazy, I still hate being lazy. So this w4nntaland thing will serves as some kind of 'diary' to keep track of my progress in doing info security stuff, and I will also upload stuff about computer science and mathematics. I really hope this can motivate me to put in work everyday and make some progress.</p>
			<p>And lastly, I really hope whoever is reading my content will enjoy it too!</p>
			<p>Peace,</p>
			<p>Phong "4nnta" Pham</p>
